  **Recommendations for students currently living in university or college/halls of residence managed accommodation:** The Residential Tenancies Act 1995  does not cover university managed accommodations, or halls of residence or college, therefore Tenny cannot aid you in your specific dispute.
      
  Universities that offer accommodation for students hold the responsibility to manage and mitigate against tenancy disputes that may arise on campus. This means that each university will have independent agreements that detail the responsibilities it holds to the student when entering a tenancy agreement. You may benefit from seeking tenancy advice directly from your university. 

  **Recommendations for students living in commercial accommodation:** The Residential Tenancies Act 1995 (‘RTA’)  does apply to commercial student accommodation (e.g. UniLodge or Urbanest) as the residence it not within an educational institution.  If you entered into a fixed term agreement, please attempt the application again and state that your lease specified an end date. If your lease does not specify and end date, Tenny is unable to assist you in your specific dispute.
