  It is important to know if your lease specifies a date in which it expires, because     this will determine whether you are in a fixed term or periodic tenancy. 
   
  If you have agreed to rent a residence for a fixed term, then this means that you       have entered an agreement for a defined period. This set amount of time would allow     you to rent a premise from a determined start date until an end date. This should be   stated in your lease agreement.
  
  If you have entered into a periodic tenancy agreement, then this means that you would   be renting a premise for a recurring period, in which a start and end date are not     specified. Periodic tenancies are intended to continue permanently, or until a party   does something to terminate the lease. A periodic tenancy agreement may also arise     from a fixed term agreement if the tenant continues to rent the property past the       original end date. The length of a ‘period’ during a periodic lease is the time         between rental payments, which are determined in the tenancy agreement. 
  
  In some situations, tenants may enter a ‘fixed short-term agreement’, which is an       agreement that lasts for 90 days or less. This agreement is considered periodic,       therefore the same rules for termination apply to these type of agreement as they do   for a periodic tenancy agreement.
